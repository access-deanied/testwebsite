## Key Takeaways from Bloomberg's Report

Apple is reportedly nearing a significant deal with Google to power its planned overhaul of the voice assistant, **Siri** [1].

According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple would pay Google approximately **$1 billion a year** for a custom version of Google’s **Gemini AI model** [2].

* **A Temporary Solution:** Apple is planning to use Google’s model as an interim measure until its own in-house AI technology is sufficiently powerful to manage the slate of upcoming features for the voice assistant [1].
* **Scale of the Model:** The custom Google AI model is expected to feature **1.2 trillion parameters**, which is a measure of the software's complexity. For context, this is roughly eight times more complex than the 150 billion parameters used in the current cloud-based version of **Apple Intelligence** [2].
* **Competitive Vetting:** Apple had previously tested models from rivals like **OpenAI** and **Anthropic** before ultimately choosing to move forward with Google [3].
* **Expected Launch:** The overhauled version of Siri is anticipated to launch next spring, though plans could still change since the launch is still months away [1].
