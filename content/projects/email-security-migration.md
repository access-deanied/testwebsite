# 🛡️ Barracuda to Proofpoint Migration & Management

## Project Overview

This critical project involved the transition of email security infrastructure for a large organization, moving from on-premise **Barracuda Email Security Gateway** appliances to the cloud-native capabilities of **Proofpoint Enterprise Protection**. The transition was complex, requiring dual-system management during the migration phase to ensure zero downtime and maintain an active cybersecurity posture.

## Key Contributions & Technical Highlights

### 1. Project Management & Planning
* **Change Management:** Developed and led the change management process, coordinating between IT, Security, and Communications teams to ensure a smooth transition with minimal user impact.
* **Dual-System Oversight:** Managed and maintained both the Barracuda and Proofpoint systems concurrently for a 4-week validation period.

### 2. Proofpoint Implementation & Tuning
* **Deployment:** Configured and deployed Proofpoint's cloud infrastructure, including the setup of all necessary Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) and DNS records (MX/SPF/DKIM/DMARC).
* **Policy Scripting:** Migrated and optimized thousands of Barracuda policies, creating a robust, streamlined policy set within **Proofpoint's centralized console**.
* **Targeted Protection:** Leveraged Proofpoint's unique features, including **Targeted Attack Protection (TAP)** and **URL Defense**, to enhance defense against phishing and advanced threats—an upgrade from the legacy system.

### 3. Decommissioning & Legacy Management
* **Barracuda Management:** Oversaw the final phase of the Barracuda system, ensuring proper log archiving and secure decommissioning of physical and virtual appliances.
* **Incident Response:** Maintained and utilized Barracuda for forensic analysis during the final days of the migration to validate all historical data was captured.

## Outcomes

* **100% successful migration** with zero service interruption for over 5,000 mailboxes.
* Reduced on-premise hardware dependency and maintenance overhead.
* Enhanced organization's cybersecurity posture, leading to a **40% reduction in detected phishing attempts** within the first month post-migration.
